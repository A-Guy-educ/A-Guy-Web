## Technical Architecture

### Data Model

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  UserProgress   │ (NEW COLLECTION)
├─────────────────┤
│ user: ref       │ → Users collection
│ gradeLevel: str │ → "8", "ח", etc.
│ progressRecords │ → Array of:
│   - recordType  │    "chapter"|"lesson"|"exercise"
│   - recordId    │    String (ID of entity)
│   - completion% │    0-100
│   - status      │    "not_started"|"in_progress"|"completed"
│   - score       │    0-100 (for exercises)
│   - lastAccess  │    Date
└─────────────────┘
```

**Existing Collections Used:**
- `Courses` - Filtered by `courseLabel` (grade level)
- `Chapters` - Displayed as "Topics" in Study/Practice modes
- `Lessons` - Displayed as "Exams" in Test mode
- `Exercises` - User's questions/exercises in Ask mode
- `Conversations` - Chat history per exercise

### Component Hierarchy

```
HomePage (/)
└── GreetingFlow
    ├── TypingAnimation
    ├── Mood Selection (Buttons)
    └── Grade Selection (Select)

StudyPage (/study)
├── NavigationBar
└── StudyContent
    └── TopicCard[] (Chapter grid)
        ├── ProgressCircle
        └── Chapter info

PracticePage (/practice)
├── NavigationBar

```

### Data Flow

**Anonymous User:**
```
1. Homepage → Check localStorage
2. No profile? → GreetingFlow → Save to localStorage
3. Has profile? → Redirect to /study
4. Study page → Fetch chapters by grade (API)
5. Display with progress from localStorage
6. Progress updates → Update localStorage
```

**Authenticated User:**
```
1. Login → Sync localStorage to database
2. Clear localStorage (database is source of truth)
3. All progress reads → Query UserProgress collection
4. All progress writes → API → Update database
5. Cross-device sync automatically works
```

### API Endpoints

**GET /api/chapters/by-grade?grade={gradeLevel}**
- Returns: `{ chapters: Chapter[], courseSlug: string }`
- Filters by courseLabel
- Only published & active courses

**POST /api/progress/update**
- Body: `{ recordId, recordType, completionPercentage, status }`
- Auth: Required (from session)
- Updates UserProgress collection
- Returns: `{ success: boolean }`

**Future: GET /api/progress/user**
- Returns: UserProgress for authenticated user
- Used to hydrate UI on page load

## Design Specifications

### Visual Design

**Color Integration:**

The design uses **existing theme variables** from `globals.css` rather than introducing new colors:

```css
/* LIGHT THEME - Use existing variables */
--primary: 217 91% 60%        /* Maps to #2d5af7 (primary actions) */
--success: 142 71% 45%        /* Maps to #27ae60 (completed items) */
--warning: 38 92% 50%         /* Maps to #f39c12 (warnings) */
--destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%  /* Maps to #e74c3c (exams/errors) */
--accent: 271 91% 65%         /* Maps to #9b59b6 (questions/ask mode) */
--background: 0 0% 100%       /* Maps to #fcfdfe (light background) */
--foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%  /* Maps to #1a1a1a (dark text) */
```

**Dark Theme Support:**
- All components use CSS variables (`hsl(var(--primary))`)
- Dark theme automatically applies when `[data-theme='dark']` is active
- No hardcoded hex colors in component code

**Usage in Components:**
```tsx
// ✅ Correct - uses theme variables
<circle stroke="hsl(var(--primary))" />
<div className="text-success">Completed</div>

// ❌ Wrong - hardcoded colors
<circle stroke="#2d5af7" />
<div style={{ color: '#27ae60' }}>Completed</div>
```

**Typography:**
- System font: Uses existing Geist font family (system-ui fallback)
- AI/Typing: `'Courier New', Courier, monospace` via `font-mono` class
- Hebrew support: Already configured in project

**Spacing:**
- Uses Tailwind spacing scale: `p-4`, `gap-4`, `mb-8`, etc.
- Container: `container mx-auto` (responsive by default)
- Grid gaps: `gap-4` (1rem / 16px)
- Card padding: Uses shadcn/ui Card defaults
- Border radius: Uses `--radius` variable (0.75rem)

**Design System Constraints:**
- ✅ **Use only:** Tailwind classes, shadcn/ui components, CSS variables
- ❌ **Never create:** New CSS/SCSS files, inline hardcoded styles, custom CSS classes
- ✅ **Styling approach:** Utility-first with Tailwind, compose with shadcn/ui
- ❌ **Forbidden:** `HomePage.module.css`, `styles.scss`, styled-components

### Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 640px | 1 column grid |
| Tablet | 640px - 1024px | 2 column grid |
| Desktop | > 1024px | 3 column grid |

### Animations

1. **Typing Animation**: 50ms per character, blinking cursor
2. **Progress Circle**: 500ms transition on value change
3. **Card Hover**: translateY(-4px) on hover, 300ms ease
4. **Fade In**: Page transitions fade + slide up, 500ms ease-out

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: localStorage Size Limits
**Impact:** High | **Probability:** Medium
**Description:** Users with extensive progress may exceed 5MB localStorage limit

**Mitigation:**
- Implement data pruning (keep last 100 records)
- Warn users to log in for unlimited storage
- Monitor localStorage usage in production
- Fallback to session-only storage if quota exceeded

### Risk 2: courseLabel Format Mismatch
**Impact:** High | **Probability:** Low
**Description:** Courses may use Hebrew ("ח") vs numeric ("8") labels inconsistently

**Mitigation:**
- Query database to verify actual values before launch
- Support both formats in filter logic
- Add admin documentation for courseLabel standards

### Risk 3: Progress Sync Conflicts
**Impact:** Medium | **Probability:** Low
**Description:** User progresses on two devices while anonymous, then logs in

**Mitigation:**
- Merge strategy keeps highest completion %
- Document sync behavior in user guide
- Add timestamp-based conflict resolution (future)

### Risk 4: Breaking Existing Homepage
**Impact:** High | **Probability:** Low
**Description:** Replacing homepage may break existing user flows or integrations

**Mitigation:**
- Create backup of existing page.tsx
- Feature flag for gradual rollout (optional)
- Monitor error rates post-deployment
- Rollback plan: restore backup file

2. QA testing on staging environment
3. Performance profiling (Lighthouse)
4. Security review (access control, data privacy)

### Launch Strategy

**Option A: Hard Cutover (Recommended)**
- Deploy all changes at once
- Monitor error rates for 24h
- Rollback plan ready

**Option B: Gradual Rollout**
- Feature flag: `ENABLE_NEW_HOMEPAGE=true`
- Roll out to 10% users → 50% → 100%
- A/B test metrics vs old homepage

### Post-Launch
1. Monitor analytics for 1 week
2. Collect user feedback
3. Fix critical bugs within 48h
4. Iterate on non-critical improvements

---

## Open Questions

1. **Mood Selection Usage:** How should mood affect content? (Future feature)
2. **Progress Weighting:** Should chapter progress auto-calculate from lesson progress?
3. **Test Mode Filtering:** Do we need a separate "exam" type for lessons?
4. **Anonymous Progress Limit:** Should we cap localStorage records? How many?
5. **Login Integration:** Where is the login success handler? (Need to add sync call)
