## 1. Title

Sluggish Typing Animation in GreetingFlow

## 2. Environment

- Environment: dev
- User Role / Tenant: Sudent or admin it is a new user facing the system for the first time

## 3. Preconditions

User is navigating to the greeting/onboarding flow (first-time entry or guest session).

The GreetingFlow component is triggered and active.

## 4. Steps to Reproduce

Open the application in a clean environment (incognito).

Enter the landing page/onboarding section.

Observe the "EduGuide AI" bot as it begins typing the welcome message.

Attempt to read along with the animation.

## 5. Expected Result

The typing animation should be 1.5 as fast as the current implementation.

Base character delay should be approximately $30\text{ms}$ to $35\text{ms}$.

The interaction should feel "snappy" and nearly instant while maintaining a subtle "human" dialogue feel.

Users should not feel the urge to "skip" the text because it is taking too long to appear

## 6. Actual Result

The animation is significantly slower than natural reading speed (estimated at $60\text{ms}$–$100\text{ms}$ per character). This results in a "crawl" effect where a single sentence takes several seconds to complete, making the application feel unresponsive or "buggy" to new users.

## 7. Reproducibility
