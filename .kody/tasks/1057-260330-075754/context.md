## Implementation Plan: Localize Teacher Profile Selection (Hebrew/English)

### Step 1: Add localized fields to TeacherProfiles collection schema

**File:** `src/server/payload/collections/TeacherProfiles.ts`

3. **`teacher-profiles/route.ts`** - Uses shared locale utility, sorts by locale-appropriate field (`label_he` or `label_en`), adds `?? ''` fallback for nullable
