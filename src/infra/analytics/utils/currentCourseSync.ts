/**
 * Best-effort sync of the user's current course + last-active timestamp to Admin.
 *
 * PATCH `{NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL}/api/users/me/course-state` with an optional
 * `currentCourse` id. Admin stamps `lastLoginAt` server-side on every
 * successful call — clients cannot forge activity timestamps, so the body
 * carries no timestamp of its own.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget: never awaited on the UX path, never surfaces errors to
 * callers, browser-only (SSR skips silently). Admin being unreachable must
 * never break the user's flow.
 *
 * Lives under `infra/` (the leaf layer) so it can be called from client,
 * infra, and app layers alike — same reason `courseSelectionTracker` would
 * belong here too, historical placement aside.
 *
 * Called from three sites:
 *   - `selectCourse` (explicit pick) — with the picked courseId
 *   - `UserIdentificationTracker` (first authenticated mount per session) —
 *     with the courseId from localStorage, but only if the server does not
 *     already have a currentCourse (do not clobber fresher server state)
 *   - `LessonAnalytics` (lesson open) — with the lesson's courseId, always
 *     overwriting server state (a live lesson open is the freshest signal)
 */

/**
 * Read the client's known courseId from the mirror cookie set by
 * `setUserProfile` in the client layer. Lives here (not in client) so the
 * infra-layer session-start sync can pull the value without violating the
 * infra-cannot-import-client layer rule. Cookie name is a stable contract
 * (`a-guy:course-id`) already relied on by server components.
