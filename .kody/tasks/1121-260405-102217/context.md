Based on my investigation, I now have a clear picture of the issue. Let me provide a summary of my findings:

## Investigation Summary

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The issue is that when users upload low-resolution or highly compressed images, they receive a generic "Upload failed" error instead of an actionable message. The problem is in the error handling flow:

1. **Vercel Blob rejection**: Vercel Blob may reject certain images (e.g., corrupted, unprocessable, or images that fail internal valid

### build (2026-04-05T11:36:43)
The implementation is complete. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Changes Made

### 1. `src/server/chat-assets/constants.ts`
Added minimum image dimension constraints:
```typescript
export const CHAT_ASSET_MIN_IMAGE_WIDTH = 100
export const CHAT_ASSET_MIN_IMAGE_HEIGHT = 100
```

### 2. `src/ui/web/chat/hooks/useDirectChatAssetUpload.ts`
- **Added `getImageDimensions()`** - loads image via `Image()` object and returns natural width/height
- **Added `isImageTooSmall()`** - checks if image dimen

### review (2026-04-05T11:38:57)
## Verdict: PASS

## Summary

Added client-side image dimension validation (100x100px minimum) before upload with actionable error messages, and improved error extraction from Vercel Blob responses to surface `serverMessage` property when available.

## Findings

### Critical
None.

### Major
None.

### Minor

- `src/ui/web/chat/hooks/useDirectChatAssetUpload.ts:291-294` — `extractBlobErrorMessage` is called after retry logic exhausted, but original code still shows `error instanceof Error ? err
