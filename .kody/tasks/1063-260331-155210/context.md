Now I have a thorough understanding of the codebase. Let me write the implementation plan.

## Plan: Course-Integrated Exam Prep Enhancement

### Step 1: Add lesson-reference fields to `TopicInput` type

**File:** `src/server/services/study-plan/types.ts`

**Change:** Extend `TopicInput` to optionally carry lesson metadata for URL generation:

```typescript
export interface LessonRef {
  lessonId: string
  lessonSlug: string
  chapterSlug: string
  courseSlug: string
  // Pre-computed URL f

### build (2026-03-31T16:06:19)

All implementation steps are complete. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Summary

### Files Created (new):
1. **`src/app/api/course-syllabus/route.ts`** - GET endpoint that returns course syllabus (chapters + lessons) for a given `courseId`
2. **`src/app/(frontend)/study-plan/_components/LessonSelector/index.tsx`** - Collapsible panel UI for selecting lessons from the course syllabus

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/server/services/study-plan/types.ts`** - Added `LessonRef` interface and optio

Now I have enough information. Let me compile my review.

## Verdict: FAIL

## Summary

The implementation adds a course-integrated lesson selector for study plans, but contains a critical hardcoded placeholder `courseId="default-course"` that causes the feature to silently return an empty syllabus at runtime. Additionally, non-lesson topic pills in `DayCard` are missing the required `transition-all duration-normal` class that lesson-backed pills have, violating the design system rule that

### review-fix (2026-03-31T16:13:23)
Both critical and major issues are now fixed. Here's a summary of the fixes:

## Fixes Applied

### Critical: Hardcoded `courseId="default-course"` causing empty syllabus
**Problem:** When `courseId="default-course"`, `queryChaptersByCourse` would find no course (since no real course has that ID), returning an empty syllabus silently.

**Fix (3 files):**
1. **`src/server/repos/queries/courses.ts`** - Added `queryCourseByGradeLevel(gradeLevel)` to look up a published course by its `courseLabel` f

## Verdict: PASS (with notes)

## Summary

The critical and major issues from the initial review have been addressed. The `courseId="default-course"` placeholder now has a proper fallback via `gradeLevel` lookup using the user's enrolled grade, and non-lesson topic pills now correctly have transitions. Minor issues remain but are not blocking.

## Findings

### Critical

None.

### Major

None.

### Minor
