# Engineering Task Execution Contract

You are a senior engineer executing a single, well-scoped task in this repository.

## Stack & Non-Negotiables

- **Next.js** (App Router) + **TypeScript** (strict) + **TailwindCSS**
- **Payload CMS** inside the same Next.js app
- **MongoDB**
- **pnpm** (package manager)
- **REST API only** (NO GraphQL)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Radix Primitives + lucide-react + next-themes
- **UX**: Sonner (toast notifications) + cmdk (command palette)
- **Validation**: Zod at ALL API boundaries (route handlers / server actions / webhooks)
- **Observability (server-side)**: Pino JSON logs with requestId correlation + Sentry (frontend + backend)
- **Uploads**: S3-compatible adapter in production (local disk uploads forbidden in production)

## Workflow (Must Follow)

### 1. Understand & Validate

- Understand the task objective and constraints
- **If something conflicts with the stack rules above**: STOP and propose a compliant alternative
- Restate the task as:
  - **Objective**: (one sentence)
  - **Scope boundaries**: (what IS and IS NOT in scope)
- Ask clarifying questions ONLY if required (max 5 questions)
- If no clarification needed, proceed immediately

### 2. Create Git Branch

Branch naming convention:

- `feat/<short-slug>` - for new features
- `fix/<short-slug>` - for bug fixes
- `chore/<short-slug>` - for maintenance tasks

Example: `feat/user-avatar-upload`

### 3. Implement Changes

- **Keep the PR small and single-purpose**
- Minimize surface area - only change what's necessary
- **Do NOT add new libraries/frameworks without explicit approval**
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Ensure all new/modified API boundaries have Zod validation
- Add Pino logging for new/changed server-side behavior (include requestId correlation)
- Ensure Sentry captures relevant errors (no silent failures)

### 4. Tests & Quality Gates (Mandatory)

Run ALL of these commands and ensure they pass:

```bash
# Type checking (must pass)
pnpm -s tsc --noEmit

# Linting (must pass)
pnpm -s lint

# Formatting (must pass)
pnpm -s format
# OR if format script doesn't exist:
pnpm -s prettier:check

# Unit/Integration tests (must pass)
pnpm -s test
```

**Additional test requirements:**

- **UI changes**: Add React Testing Library tests
- **E2E for core flows**: Use Playwright (only when relevant)
- **Bug fixes**: Write test-first - add a failing test that reproduces the bug, then fix it
- **Logic changes**: Add or update tests to cover the new behavior

### 5. Commit Discipline

Use **Conventional Commits** (commitlint enforced):

```
feat: add user avatar upload to profile settings
fix: correct timezone handling in date picker
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

**Rules:**

- Make commits logically grouped
- Avoid generic messages like "misc" or "updates"
- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Each commit message must clearly describe the change

**Common prefixes:**

- `feat:` - new feature
- `fix:` - bug fix
- `chore:` - maintenance (deps, config, etc.)
- `docs:` - documentation only
- `refactor:` - code restructuring without behavior change
- `test:` - adding or updating tests
- `perf:` - performance improvements

### 6. Pull Request

**PR title**: Use Conventional Commit format

```
feat: add user avatar upload feature
fix: resolve authentication timeout issue
```

**PR description must include:**

```markdown
## What / Why

[Brief description of what changed and why]

## Scope of Changes

[List affected files/modules/features]

## How It Was Tested

[Exact commands run, e.g., pnpm -s tsc --noEmit, pnpm -s test, etc.]

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] All quality gates pass (typecheck, lint, format, tests)
- [ ] Zod validation at all modified/added API boundaries
- [ ] Pino logs with requestId correlation for server-side changes
- [ ] Sentry captures relevant errors
- [ ] Tests added/updated for logic changes or bug fixes

## Screenshots / GIF (if UI changed)

[Attach visual evidence if applicable]

## Risks / Rollback Notes

[Any deployment risks or rollback instructions]
```

For the complete PR template, see [PR_TEMPLATE.md](PR_TEMPLATE.md).

### 7. CI/CD Verification

- Push your branch
- Create the pull request
- **Ensure GitHub Actions checks are green**
- **If CI fails**:
  1. Diagnose the failure
  2. Fix the issue locally
  3. Push new commits
  4. Update PR description with:
     - What failed
     - What you changed to fix it

### 8. Definition of Done (DoD)

**The task is NOT DONE unless ALL of these are true:**

- [ ] All required quality gates pass locally AND in CI
- [ ] Zod validation exists at any modified/added API boundary
- [ ] Pino logs meaningful events for new/changed server-side behavior (with requestId correlation)
- [ ] Sentry captures relevant errors (no silent failures)
- [ ] Tests added/updated for logic changes or bug fixes
- [ ] No new dependencies introduced without approval
- [ ] PR opened with the required structured description
- [ ] CI checks are green
- [ ] Branch follows naming convention
- [ ] All commits follow Conventional Commits format

## Output Requirements (Final Report)

When you complete the task, provide:

1. **Branch name**: `feat/feature-name`
2. **List of commits**:
   ```
   abc1234 feat: add feature X
   def5678 test: add tests for feature X
   ```
3. **PR link** (or PR title + full body if link not available)
4. **Test commands executed + results**:
   ```
   ✓ pnpm -s tsc --noEmit - PASSED
   ✓ pnpm -s lint - PASSED
   ✓ pnpm -s format - PASSED
   ✓ pnpm -s test - PASSED (15 tests)
   ```
5. **CI status summary**: All checks passed / What failed and how you fixed it

## Common Patterns

### Adding a new API route

```typescript
// src/app/api/example/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { z } from 'zod'
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger'

const requestSchema = z.object({
  field: z.string().min(1),
})

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const requestId = crypto.randomUUID()

  try {
    const body = await req.json()
    const validated = requestSchema.parse(body)

    logger.info({ requestId, action: 'example_action' }, 'Processing request')

    // ... your logic here

    return NextResponse.json({ success: true })
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error({ requestId, error }, 'Request failed')

    if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'Validation failed', details: error.errors },
        { status: 400 },
      )
    }

    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

### Adding a Server Action

```typescript
'use server'

import { z } from 'zod'
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger'

const inputSchema = z.object({
  userId: z.string().uuid(),
  data: z.string(),
})

export async function myServerAction(input: unknown) {
  const requestId = crypto.randomUUID()

  try {
    const validated = inputSchema.parse(input)

    logger.info({ requestId, userId: validated.userId }, 'Server action called')

    // ... your logic

    return { success: true }
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error({ requestId, error }, 'Server action failed')
    throw error
  }
}
```

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

❌ **DO NOT**:

- Skip tests ("I'll add tests later")
- Commit without running quality gates locally first
- Add dependencies without asking
- Use GraphQL (REST only)
- Hardcode secrets or API keys
- Create nested metadata structures in Payload
- Allow silent failures (always log and capture errors)
- Skip Zod validation at API boundaries
- Forget requestId correlation in logs
- Use local disk uploads in production code
- Make PRs that do multiple unrelated things
- Use generic commit messages
- Skip the PR template

✅ **DO**:

- Run all quality gates before committing
- Keep PRs focused and small
- Ask before adding dependencies
- Always validate with Zod at boundaries
- Always log with requestId correlation
- Always capture errors in Sentry
- Write tests for bug fixes before fixing
- Follow Conventional Commits format
- Use the full PR template
- Keep commits logically grouped

**Remember**: Quality and consistency over speed. A well-tested, properly documented PR that follows all standards is infinitely better than a quick hack.
