/**
 * Manual orchestrator trigger for a single LessonDuplications record.
 *
 * POST /api/lesson-duplications/:id/process-now
 *
 * Admin-only. Calls runDuplicationOrchestrator on the record with the same
 * deadline behaviour as the cron worker: process as many exercises as fit in
 * the Vercel function lifetime, then return. If work remains, the record
 * stays in `running` and the next cron tick (or manual click) continues from
 * there.
 *
 * Use cases:
 *  - Dev environments where Vercel cron schedules don't fire (preview tier).
 *  - Production "kick now" for an admin who doesn't want to wait for the
 *    next 1-minute cron tick.
 *  - Resuming a record that the cron worker skipped (e.g. lock held by a
 *    crashed previous tick — though those expire in CLAIM_LOCK_MS).
