# High-Level Specification (HLS)

## Stage 4 — Chat Integration (Admin Chat as Automation Control Plane)

### Purpose

Integrate an **Admin Chat interface** that operates as a **safe control plane** for Automations, using the same rules, limits, and validations as the Admin Wizard (Stage 3).
Chat must **not introduce new capabilities**—it is an alternative UI that drives the same engine.

---

## Goals

- Allow admins to create, edit, enable/disable, and inspect Automations via chat
- Reuse **Stage 3 Wizard logic** (no parallel business rules)
- Enforce identical guardrails, limits, and validations
- Provide conversational guidance and clarification questions
- Offer quick observability (“what’s running / what failed”) without debugging

---

## Non-Goals

- No freeform workflow design
- No bypassing Admin Wizard limits
- No secrets exposure
- No deep debugging or n8n graph editing
- No end-user chat (admin-only)

---

## Core Principle

**Chat = UI layer only**
**Wizard + Automations Engine = Source of Truth**

If Chat can do something, the Wizard can do it too—and vice versa.

---

## Capabilities

### Supported Chat Intents (MVP)

1. **Create Automation**
   - “When a lesson is completed, send a message”
   - “If a student is inactive for 3 days, send an email”

2. **Edit Automation**
   - “Change the cooldown to 24 hours”
   - “Disable this automation”
   - “Use a different email template”

3. **Inspect Automation**
   - “What automations are active?”
   - “Why is this automation suspended?”
   - “Show last runs for automation X”

4. **Explain Automation**
   - “What does this automation do?”
   - “Which variables does it use?”

5. **Safety Responses**
   - “This automation exceeds admin-safe limits. Please escalate to a developer.”

---

## Chat Interaction Model

### Intent → Wizard Mapping

Each chat intent is translated into:

- Wizard Step(s)
- Or a Wizard-compatible update (diff)

**Example**
User:

> “Send a reminder email if a student doesn’t log in for 3 days”

Chat:

1. Identifies intent: `create automation`
2. Maps to Wizard flow:
   - Trigger: scheduled → inactive users
   - Variable needed: `inactive_days_threshold`
   - Action: trigger workflow (email)

3. Asks missing questions:
   - “Which email template?”
   - “How often can this run?”

Only after all required fields are collected → create Automation.

---

## MCP / Tooling Layer

### Required MCP Tools (Admin-Only)

- `list_automations()`
- `get_automation(automationId)`
- `create_automation(payload)`
- `update_automation(automationId, diff)`
- `enable_automation(automationId)`
- `disable_automation(automationId)`
- `list_variables()`
- `create_variable(payload)` (inline creation support)
- `preview_automation(automationDraft)`

**Rules**

- Tools validate exactly like Wizard endpoints
- Tools reject any request that violates Stage 3 limits

---

## Validation & Guardrails

### Hard Stops (same as Stage 3)

Chat must refuse and explain when:

- > 2 conditions requested
- Multiple actions requested
- Unsupported schedule requested (freeform cron)
- Non-allowlisted workflow requested
- Missing or disabled variable key

### Clarification Questions

Chat must ask when:

- Trigger details missing
- Variable value/key unclear
- Action target ambiguous

Chat must **never guess**.

---

## Variable Handling in Chat

- Chat prefers existing variable keys
- If admin types a raw number/text:
  - Chat proposes creating or reusing a Variable
  - Inline variable creation allowed via MCP tool

- Chat never hard-codes values into Automations

---

## Observability via Chat

### Supported Queries

- “What automations are active?”
- “Show last 5 runs of automation X”
- “Why is automation X suspended?”

### Response Rules

- Summarize status and last outcome
- Do not expose stack traces
- Point to Admin UI for deeper inspection if needed

---

## Security & Permissions

- Chat accessible only to Admin roles
- Every mutation records:
  - actor
  - timestamp
  - before/after diff (via existing audit)

- Chat cannot elevate permissions or override system suspensions

---

## Failure & Safety Messaging

When blocked, Chat responds with:

- Clear reason
- Suggested next step (e.g., “Open in Admin UI” or “Escalate to developer”)

No silent failures.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Admin can create an automation via chat end-to-end
- Chat enforces identical limits as Wizard
- Chat never creates invalid Automations
- Variables are reused or created correctly
- Chat can explain and disable automations
- All actions are auditable and visible in Admin UI

---

# Tests — Stage 4 (Chat Integration)

## Unit Tests

- Intent parsing → correct Wizard mapping
- Clarification logic:
  - missing trigger → question asked
  - ambiguous variable → proposal made

- Refusal logic:
  - blocks multi-action requests
  - blocks >2 conditions

## Integration Tests

- Chat → create automation → Automation stored correctly
- Chat → update automation → diff applied correctly
- Chat → inline variable creation → Variables updated + referenced
- Chat → disable automation → status updated

## Contract Tests (MCP)

- Tool inputs validated server-side
- Invalid payloads rejected consistently with Wizard endpoints
- No tool allows bypassing limits

## Safety Tests

- Chat cannot:
  - inject raw secrets
  - hard-code values
  - trigger non-allowlisted workflows

- Suspended automations cannot be re-enabled without explicit admin action

---

## Exit Criteria

- Chat and Wizard produce identical Automations for the same intent
- No duplicate business logic between Chat and Wizard
- Admin can operate the full lifecycle (create → edit → inspect → disable) via chat
- Complex requests are consistently refused with clear messaging
