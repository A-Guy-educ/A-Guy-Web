/**
 * Schema version constant for cached InteractiveLesson payloads
 *
 * @ai-summary Bump when the InteractiveLesson/InteractiveLessonStep shape changes in ways that break the client converter or renderer — older cached rows with mismatched versions are evicted on read and regenerated. Prompt template changes do NOT need a bump (tracked by promptId + updatedAt separately). Adding a new optional field doesn't need a bump if the converter tolerates its absence. Changes that warrant a bump: adding/removing required fields, renaming fields the converter reads, changing encodings (e.g. audioBase64 → audioUrl).
