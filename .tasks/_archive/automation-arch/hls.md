# High-Level Specification (HLS)

## Stage 2 — Automations Architecture (Events → Rules → n8n Execution)

### Purpose

Implement the core automation engine that connects **system events** (and scheduled checks) to **admin-managed automation rules**, and triggers **n8n workflows** as the execution engine. This stage must integrate with **Stage 1 Variables** (resolved values, not hard-coded literals).

---

## Goals

- Provide an admin-manageable “When X happens → do Y” automation system
- Support two trigger modes:
  - **Event-based** (immediate)
  - **Schedule-based** (periodic polling)

- Trigger **n8n workflows** with a standard payload envelope
- Enforce lifecycle, safety guardrails, and observability (runs/logs)
- Use **Variables** for thresholds/templates/limits (no hard-coded config)

---

## Non-Goals

- No freeform workflow design in Payload (n8n remains the designer)
- No complex expressions language for filters
- No multi-action automations in MVP (Action = one target)
- No full Chat Wizard (Stage 3)

---

## Core Concepts

### EventType (Catalog)

A dev-defined list of events the system can emit (schema + meaning). Admin cannot invent new EventTypes.

### Automation (Rule)

A single rule that connects:

- Trigger (event OR schedule)
- Conditions (simple)
- Target (n8n workflow)
- Guardrails (cooldown, rate limits)
- Status (enabled, suspended)

### Dispatcher

A server-side component that:

- Receives events (or schedule ticks)
- Finds matching automations
- Evaluates conditions
- Resolves variables
- Triggers n8n
- Records runs

---

## Data Model

### Collection: `EventTypes` (Catalog)

**Fields**

- `eventType` (string, unique) e.g. `lesson.completed`
- `description` (string)
- `payloadSchema` (json) (lightweight schema for documentation/validation)
- `enabled` (boolean)

> Source of truth for event names and expected payload shape.

---

### Collection: `Workflows` (Catalog)

**Fields**

- `workflowId` (string, unique; from n8n)
- `name` (string)
- `description` (string)
- `inputSchema` (json, optional)
- `enabled` (boolean)
- `adminEditable` (boolean) (used later in Stage 3/4)

> This is an allowlist and metadata registry for n8n flows.

---

### Collection: `Automations`

Automation is the admin-managed rule.

**Fields**

- `name` (string)
- `enabled` (boolean)
- `status` (enum): `active | disabled | suspended`
- `suspendReason` (string, optional)

**Trigger**

- `triggerType` (enum): `event | schedule`
- If `event`:
  - `eventType` (relationship to EventTypes)

- If `schedule`:
  - `schedule` (string, MVP format: `daily@09:00`, `hourly`, `every_15m`)
  - `scheduleTimezone` (string, default `Asia/Jerusalem`)

**Conditions (simple, MVP)**

- `conditions` (array of condition objects, max 2)
  - `{ fieldPath, op, value }`
  - `op` in: `eq | ne | lt | lte | gt | gte | in | contains`
  - `fieldPath` refers to event payload or derived context

**Target**

- `workflow` (relationship to Workflows)
- `workflowMode` (enum): `sync | async` (MVP: async)
- `workflowInput` (json template, optional; minimal mapping)

**Guardrails**

- `cooldownSeconds` (number, default 0)
- `maxRunsPerHour` (number, optional)
- `dedupeKeyPath` (string, optional) e.g. `payload.userId`

**Variables**

- `variableKeysUsed` (array<string>)
  Declared list of variable keys required for this automation (resolved at trigger time).

**Metadata**

- `createdBy`, `updatedBy`, timestamps

---

### Collection: `AutomationRuns`

Operational log.

**Fields**

- `automation` (relationship)
- `triggerType` (`event|schedule`)
- `eventType` (string, optional)
- `workflowId` (string)
- `status` (enum): `started | succeeded | failed | skipped`
- `startedAt`, `finishedAt`
- `errorCode`, `errorMessage` (short)
- `inputSnapshot` (json; minimal, safe)
- `context` (json; courseId/programId/userId if applicable)
- `n8nExecutionId` (string, optional)
- `dedupeKey` (string, optional)

---

## Event Bus Interface (Internal)

### Emit Event

A simple internal function used by app code:

- `emitEvent(eventType, payload, context)`

**Context**

- `userId?`
- `courseId?`
- `programId?`

> MVP implementation can be “in-process dispatcher call” (no external queue). If later needed, replace with a proper queue without changing Automations API.

---

## Schedule Triggering (No Cron in App)

### Scheduler Strategy

- n8n can run schedules, but Stage 2 needs a baseline. Pick one MVP approach:

**Recommended MVP (simple): app-owned scheduler**

- A single server job runner tick (e.g. every minute) that checks due schedules and runs them.
- Reason: keeps “automations defined in Payload” consistent, without requiring n8n schedules per automation.

**Alternative (n8n-owned scheduler):**

- A single n8n cron calls `POST /automation/schedule-tick` and app decides what’s due.
- Also acceptable if you prefer n8n to handle timing.

Either way, the scheduling logic must:

- select due automations
- enforce rate limits
- create runs
- execute target workflow

---

## Dispatcher Logic

### Event-Based Dispatch

1. Receive `(eventType, payload, context)`
2. Load enabled automations where:
   - `triggerType=event`
   - `eventType matches`
   - `status=active`

3. For each automation:
   - Evaluate conditions (max 2)
   - Enforce cooldown/dedupe
   - Resolve variables (Stage 1 `resolveVariables`)
   - Build workflow payload envelope
   - Trigger n8n workflow
   - Record run: started → success/fail

### Schedule-Based Dispatch

1. On tick:
2. Find due automations with `triggerType=schedule`
3. For each:
   - Compute “query” via automation definition (MVP: schedule automations call a fixed internal endpoint you own, like `inactive-users`, later configurable)
   - Enforce cooldown/dedupe
   - Resolve variables
   - Trigger n8n workflow
   - Record runs

> MVP recommended limitation: schedule automations support only predefined “scheduled triggers” (e.g. `inactive_users`) rather than arbitrary queries.

---

## Payload Envelope to n8n

When triggering n8n, always send:

```json
{
  "automation": {
    "automationId": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "triggerType": "event",
    "eventType": "lesson.completed"
  },
  "context": {
    "userId": "...",
    "courseId": "...",
    "programId": "..."
  },
  "payload": {
    /* raw event payload OR scheduled result item */
  },
  "variables": {
    /* resolved key->value */
  }
}
```

Rules:

- No secrets in payload
- Variables are resolved values only
- Keep payload minimal (IDs preferred)

---

## Safety & Lifecycle

### Auto-Suspension Policy (MVP)

- If an automation fails **N times in a row** (default N=5) → set `status=suspended`
- Store `suspendReason` with latest error summary
- Admin can re-enable manually

### Guardrail Defaults

- `cooldownSeconds`: required for messaging-like automations (recommend min 3600)
- `maxRunsPerHour`: default 100 (tunable via Variables)

---

## Observability (Admin View Requirements)

- Automations list shows:
  - status, enabled
  - lastRunAt, lastStatus
  - failureCountRecent (last 24h)

- Automation detail shows:
  - last 20 runs
  - ability to disable immediately
  - suspend reason if suspended

---

## Integration with Stage 1 Variables

- Each automation declares `variableKeysUsed`
- Dispatcher resolves them per event context:
  - course/program scoped values override global

- Missing variable is a **hard failure** (record run as failed, may contribute to suspension)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Admin can create an Event-based automation that triggers a chosen n8n workflow
- Admin can create a Schedule-based automation that runs on a defined schedule tick
- Runs are recorded with status and error summaries
- Cooldown/dedupe prevent repeated spam
- Variable resolution is used (no hard-coded thresholds/templates)
- After repeated failures, automation becomes `suspended`

---

# Tests — Stage 2 (Automations Architecture)

## Test Strategy

- **Unit tests** for dispatcher logic (conditions, cooldown, dedupe, variable resolution calls, payload envelope building)
- **Integration tests** for Payload collections + hooks + run logging
- **Contract tests** for n8n trigger request shape (mock n8n endpoint)

---

## Unit Tests

### Dispatcher — Event-based

- Finds only matching automations:
  - `triggerType=event`, `eventType=...`, `status=active`, `enabled=true`

- Condition evaluation:
  - `eq/ne/lt/lte/gt/gte/in/contains` on payload fields
  - max 2 conditions enforced (reject save or ignore extras per spec)

- Cooldown behavior:
  - same dedupeKey within cooldown → run status `skipped`

- Dedupe key derivation:
  - from `dedupeKeyPath` (e.g. payload.userId)

- Variable resolution:
  - calls Stage 1 resolver with declared keys and context
  - fails if resolver fails (run failed)

- Payload envelope:
  - includes automation metadata, context, payload, variables
  - never includes secrets

### Dispatcher — Schedule-based

- Selects due automations based on schedule rules
- Rate limiting: `maxRunsPerHour`
- Cooldown applied per dedupeKey or per automation default
- Triggers workflow for each due automation, logs run

### Auto-suspension

- After N consecutive failures:
  - automation status becomes `suspended`
  - suspendReason set

- On success:
  - consecutive failure counter resets (if tracked)

---

## Integration Tests (Payload)

### Models & Constraints

- `EventTypes.eventType` unique
- `Workflows.workflowId` unique
- `Automations` validation:
  - event trigger requires eventType
  - schedule trigger requires schedule format
  - workflow must exist and be enabled
  - conditions array max length = 2
  - variableKeysUsed must reference existing Variables keys (optional strictness: validate at save or at run)

### Runs Logging

- On trigger:
  - creates `AutomationRuns.started`
  - updates to `succeeded/failed/skipped`
  - stores `n8nExecutionId` when available

- Error truncation:
  - errorMessage limited (no stack dumps in admin)

### Lifecycle

- disabling an automation stops execution
- suspended automation does not execute until re-enabled

---

## Contract Tests (n8n)

- Mock n8n webhook endpoint:
  - verify request body matches payload envelope schema
  - verify headers/auth are present (if used)

- Failure responses:
  - n8n 500 → run failed, contributes to suspension
  - network timeout → run failed

---

## CI Gate

- Add Stage 2 tests to the standard suite:
  - unit + integration
  - ensure deterministic timing (use fake timers for schedules/cooldowns)
