# Build Agent Report: orchestrated-pipeline

## Branch

- **Branch:** feat/orchestrated-pipeline

## Changes

- **`.github/workflows/pipeline-orchestrated.yml`** - Fixed 15 issues blocking workflow execution:
  - Added missing `pnpm/action-setup` step (critical - workflow would fail without pnpm)
  - Fixed CLI arg parsing to handle `--key=value` syntax (critical - all args were silently ignored)
  - Fixed shell injection vulnerability in safety check using env vars (critical - security fix)
  - Added `GH_TOKEN` to parse job for error comment posting (critical - error feedback)
  - Fixed sed regex for `/oc` prefix stripping (was broken)
  - Simplified `--feedback` extraction (was fragile for multi-word)
  - Fixed `DRY_RUN` boolean expansion (always truthy due to `"false"` string)
  - Added `timeout-minutes` to jobs (parse: 5min, orchestrate: 60min)
  - Downgraded action versions to v4 for compatibility

- **`.github/workflows/opencode.yml`** - Prevented dual trigger:
  - Added exclusions for pipeline commands (`/oc spec`, `/oc impl`, `/oc rerun`, `/oc full`, `/oc status`) to prevent running alongside pipeline-orchestrated.yml

- **`scripts/orchestrator-utils.ts`** - Fixed CLI parser:
  - Added normalization logic to handle both `--flag value` and `--flag=value` argument syntax

- **`tests/unit/scripts/orchestrator.spec.ts`** - Added unit tests (50 tests):
  - CLI argument parsing (parseCliArgs)
  - Auth validation (validateAuth)
  - Status management (initStatus, updateStageStatus, readStatus, completeStatus)
  - Pipeline flow tests (spec, impl, rerun)
  - File watch/timeout detection
  - Failure handling, retry logic, status comment formatting
  - GitHub comment posting, validation helpers, edge cases

- **`tests/int/scripts/orchestrator.int.spec.ts`** - Added integration tests (25 tests):
  - Full CLI argument parsing integration
  - Status file management (read/write)
  - Timeout handling, failure handling with error messages
  - Retry exhaustion tracking, stage file operations
  - Task validation, comment formatting for all states
  - Pipeline stage definitions, rerun logic

## Quality

- TypeScript: PASS (pnpm tsc --noEmit)
- Lint: PASS (only pre-existing warnings, no errors)
- YAML Syntax: PASS (validated with js-yaml)
